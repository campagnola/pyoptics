PyOptics
========

Geometric optics raytracing in python for education and small-project design. This 
is a simple, alpha-quality project with no current plans for future development.

See also: GeOptics https://github.com/ederag/geoptics

Features
--------

* Ray tracing with a small library of optical parts (lenses, mirrors, prism)
* Catalog of Shott and other common glasses for dispersion modeling
* GUI for interactively placing optics and visualizing raytracing output 

Examples
--------

The quickest way to learn what's in here is to read and/or run the examples:

* `dispersion.py` : a prism separating white light into rainbow
* `mirror.py` : simple combination of mirrors reflecting parallel rays
* `2p_telescope.py` : test of wavelength-dependence of focal point in a laser-scanning microscopy setup
* `2p_telescope2.py` : animated simulation of laser scanning microscopy setup

Use the mouse to pan/zoom around the models.
